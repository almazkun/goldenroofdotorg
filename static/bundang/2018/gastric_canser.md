<h2 class="c-display-5">Number of Stomach Neoplasm or Gastric Cancer Surgery Cases </h2>
<p class="lead">The number of cases where the patient was diagnosed with stomach neoplasm or gastric cancer, and underwent surgery.</p>

**Stomach neoplasm**: An abnormal proliferation of gastric cells. The subtypes are classified according to the location, shape, and size of the tumor (benign or malignant), and include polyp, adenoma, submucosal tumor, but exclude gastric cancer. 

**Gastric cancer**: A form of malignant tumor in the stomach, generally referring to adenocarcinoma.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Percentage of Minimally Invasive Surgery for Gastric Cancer</h2>
<p class="lead">The proportion of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer, who received a minimally invasive surgery such as laparoscopic surgery or robotic surgery.</p>

**Laparoscopic surgery:** A method of surgery where devices such as a video camera are inserted into the abdominal cavity of the patient through a small, not large, incision (one 2.5 cm hole or 3 to 5 holes within 1.5 cm) made on the abdomen. 

**Robotic surgery:** A method of laparoscopic surgery where the surgeon remote-controls a patient-mounted medical robot, which is a cutting-edge surgical device.

</figure>

Minimally invasive surgery such as robotic surgery or laparoscopic surgery shows equivalent rates of survival, mortality, and complication to open surgery, while the small size of the surgical incision and the wound allow a small scar, rapid recovery, and reduced pain. As the figure above shows, the percentage of MIS at SNUBH has increased annually, reaching 93 - 95%.

<p class="lead">The number of cases where the patient diagnosed with gastric cancer was given a functional preservation surgery to minimize the loss of the stomach function (proximal gastrectomy, pylorus preserving gastrectomy, and sentinel node navigation surgery).</p>

**Proximal gastrectomy:** A form of surgery that removes the upper part of the stomach (20 - 40 %).

**Pylorus preserving gastrectomy:** A form of surgery that preserves the function of pylorus, a muscular valve that connects the stomach to the duodenum, to ensure continued food digestion and to prevent a digestive fluid reflux.

**Sentinel node navigation surgery:** A form of surgery that preserves the stomach and the vagus nerves maximally, where only the sentinel node prone to metastasis is surgically removed.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Number of Single-port Gastrectomy Cases</h2>
<p class="lead">The number of cases where the patient diagnosed with gastric cancer was given a single-port laparoscopy.</p>

**Single-port gastrectomy:** A form of oncoplastic surgery performed through a single hole of approx. 2.5 - 3.5 cm made on the umbilicus, based on which the laparoscopic camera and special devices are used.

<figure class="my-4">

    <figcaption class="text-muted text-center">Fig. 5. Number of Single-port Gastrectomy Cases.</figcaption>
</figure>

The conventional laparoscopic surgery relies on around 5 holes made on the abdomen and an incision of 3 - 4 cm for taking out the specimens; however, the single-port gastrectomy requires only a single incision of 2.5 cm inside of the umbilicus so that the resulting scar is almost invisible and the recovery time as well as the pain are reduced. The procedure has been performed since 2010, and the number of cases amounts to around 500 cases, which is the largest number of cases in the world.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Average Postoperative Length of Stay</h2>
<p class="lead">The average length of stay of patients who received gastric cancer surgery.</p>

**Length of stay:** The number of days from the date of surgery to the date of discharge, of patients who received gastric cancer surgery.

**Average postoperative length of stay:** The sum of all of the total lengths of stay of patients who received gastric cancer surgery divided by the number of patients who received the surgery.

**Clinical pathway (CP):** A standardized clinical course based on a preset sequence of care and treatments optimized for a specific group of diseases or patients. 

<figure class="my-4">

    <figcaption class="text-muted text-center">Fig. 7. Average postoperative length of stay after gastric cancer surgery.</figcaption>
</figure>

The reduced length of stay indicates the fast rate of recovery after surgery. The rate is improving year by year, and it is important since it may decrease the burden such as the admission fee and enable an early return to daily life. 

Clinical pathway (CP) that standardizes the clinical course from gastric cancer surgery to discharge, has been in use since 2008. Early Recovery Program has been run to reduce the length of stay since 2014. 

Description of CP for gastric cancer surgery (combined with Early Recovery Program):

1. Minimized fasting hour prior to surgery (Up to 6 hours pre-surgery: solid food diet; Up to 2 hours pre-surgery: liquid carbohydrate diet).
2. No bowel enema prior to surgery.
3. No insertion of the Levin tube*.
    * *Levin tube: A tube inserted through the nose to the stomach, to empty the stomach for gastrointestinal surgery 
4. No insertion of drainage tube* after surgery (single-port laparoscopy) or the fast removal of a tube within a day of surgery.
    * *Drainage tube: A tube fixed to the area of surgery to remove the accumulation of unnecessary body fluids, which may cause an infection upon the long-term attachment or induce discomfort or pain during the attachment 
5. Early meal: On day 1 post-surgery (sips of water); On day 2 (rice water); On day 3 (rice porridge).
6. Early discharge: Distal gastrectomy (on day 5 post-surgery); Total gastrectomy (on day 6 post-surgery).

<h2 class="c-display-5">Postoperative Complications</h2>
<p class="lead">The proportion of patients who experienced a postoperative complication within 30 days of gastric cancer surgery.</p>

**Complications:** All medical or surgical complications that arise after gastric cancer surgery, ranging from fever, a mild complication, to major ones, such as hemorrhage, leakage (when a part of the connected organ leaks out), anastomotic stenosis or blockage (when the area connecting the intestines becomes narrow), lung complications (when the lungs shrink or experience inflammation after general anesthesia surgery), or perforation (when a puncture occurs in an organ).

**Major complications:** Complications that require intervention, revision surgery, or intensive treatment (Clavien-Dindo IIla or above).

**Stage:** The extent of the cancer cells spread or the progression of cancer (The stages are classified based on the depth of cancer; the extent of the lymph node metastasis; the status of metastasis to other organs).

**Gastric cancer stages are classified based on the TNM into Stage I, II, III, and IV:**

* T stands for Tumor, and defines the stage based on how many layers the tumor has invaded from its original locus. 

* N stands for Node in Lymph Node, and defines the stage based on metastasis to the local lymph nodes around the stomach (In all other cases, based on distant metastasis).

* M stands for Metastasis, and defines the stage based on distant metastasis.
