MIS (Robot-assisted + •  Minimally Invasive Laparoscopy) Surgery (%) 
Laparoscopic surgery has several benefits compared to open surgery including reduced blood loss during surgery, reduced hospital length of stay, and enhanced recovery. Thus, laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is continuously increasing at SNUBH.

The length of stay indicates a decreasing trend, compared to the increased number of colorectal cancer surgery cases. The reduced length of stay may decrease the burden of the patient including hospital fees and allow an early return to normal daily life.

Colorectal Cancer 
Percentage of Sphincter Preservation for Rectal Cancer The percentage of sphincter preservation surgery out of the total number of surgical procedures for rectal cancer 
> Definitions 0 Sphincter preservation : A surgery that preserves the sphincter function while removing a tumor located in low-lying parts of the rectum near the anus in colorectal cancer. Frequently performed procedures include low or ultra-low anterior resection, intersphincteric resection, transanal local excision, and Hartmann's operation. Miles' operation and pelvic exenteration sacrifice the anus and are thus not regarded as sphincter preservation procedures.

Rectal Cancer Surgery (Case) Sphincter Preservation Rate (%) 
The greatest concern of patients prior to surgery is sphincter preservation. In 2017 at SNUBH, 95.1 % of the patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery were given successful sphincter preservation.

' Postoperative Complications, Colorectal Cancer (Colon & Rectal Cancer) The proportion of patients who experienced a postoperative complication within 30 days of colorectal cancer surgery 
> Definitions © Postoperative complications : All surgery-related illnesses caused within 30 days of surgery, including surgical site infection, anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and post-operative ileus. © Surgical site infection : Infection of the incision area after surgery. O Anastomotic leakage : A complication where the intestinal contents leak out from the area connecting the intestines (anastomosis site) together in the abdominal cavity. (0 Gastrointestinal bleeding : Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract after surgery that mostly occurs at the anastomosis site and may accompany intestinal fistula or hematochezia. © Post-operative ileus : A complication where the bowel contents do not move fluently after surgery, most commonly due to paralytic ileus, accompanying bloating or vomiting.
