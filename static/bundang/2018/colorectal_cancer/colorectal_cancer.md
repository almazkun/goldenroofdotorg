<h2 class="c-display-5">Percentage of Minimally Invasive Surgery for Colorectal Cancer</h2>
<p class="lead">The proportion of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, who received a minimally invasive surgery such as a laparoscopic or robotic surgery.</p>

**Robotic surgery:** A method of laparoscopic surgery where the surgeon remote-controls a patient-mounted medical robotic device (da Vinci Surgical System, Intuitive Inc.), which is a cutting edge surgical device.

**Laparoscopic surgery:** A method of surgery where devices such as a video camera are inserted into the abdominal cavity of the patient through a number of small, not large, incisions made on the abdomen.

Laparoscopic surgery has several benefits compared to open surgery including reduced blood loss during surgery, reduced hospital length of stay, and enhanced recovery. Thus, laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is continuously increasing at SNUBH.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Average Postoperative Length of Stay, Colorectal Cancer</h2>
<p class="lead">The average length of stay of patients who received colorectal cancer surgery.</p>

**Length of stay:** The number of days from surgery to the day of discharge, of patients who received colorectal cancer surgery (The day of surgery is regarded as Day 0).

**Average postoperative length of stay:** The sum of all lengths of stay of the patients who received colorectal cancer surgery divided by the number of patients who received the surgery (The patients with an unclear medical record were excluded).

</figure>

The length of stay indicates a decreasing trend, compared to the increased number of colorectal cancer surgery cases. The reduced length of stay may decrease the burden of the patient including hospital fees and allow an early return to normal daily life.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Percentage of Sphincter Preservation for Rectal Cancer</h2>
<p class="lead">The percentage of sphincter preservation surgery out of the total number of surgical procedures for rectal cancer.</p>

**Sphincter preservation:** A surgery that preserves the sphincter function while removing a tumor located in low-lying parts of the rectum near the anus in colorectal cancer. Frequently performed procedures include low or ultra-low anterior resection, intersphincteric resection, transanal local excision, and Hartmann's operation. Miles' operation and pelvic exenteration sacrifice the anus and are thus not regarded as sphincter preservation procedures.

    <figcaption class="text-muted text-center">Fig. 4.The percentage of sphincter preservation surgery out of the total number of surgical procedures.</figcaption>

The greatest concern of patients prior to surgery is sphincter preservation. In 2017 at SNUBH, 95.1% of the patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery were given successful sphincter preservation.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Postoperative Complications, Colorectal Cancer (Colon & Rectal Cancer)</h2>
<p class="lead">The proportion of patients who experienced a postoperative complication within 30 days of colorectal cancer surgery.</p>

**Postoperative complications:** All surgery-related illnesses caused within 30 days of surgery, including surgical site infection, anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and post-operative ileus.

**Surgical site infection:** Infection of the incision area after surgery.

**Anastomotic leakage:** A complication where the intestinal contents leak out from the area connecting the intestines (anastomosis site) together in the abdominal cavity.

**Gastrointestinal bleeding:** Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract after surgery that mostly occurs at the anastomosis site and may accompany intestinal fistula or hematochezia.

**Post-operative ileus:** A complication where the bowel contents do not move fluently after surgery, most commonly due to paralytic ileus, accompanying bloating or vomiting.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Thirty Day Postoperative Mortality Rate, Colorectal Cancer</h2>
<p class="lead">The proportion of patients who died within 30 days of elective surgery for colorectal cancer.</p>

**Mortality rate:** The proportion of patients who died within 30 days, among those who received elective colorectal cancer surgery (The emergency cases are excluded).

**Within 30 days (of surgery):** The discharged patients who died during the period of 30 days post-surgery.

**Elective surgery:** All surgical procedures scheduled in advance for both inpatients and outpatients; opposite in meaning to emergency procedures where the decision to undergo surgery is based on the urgency of the clinical situation.
