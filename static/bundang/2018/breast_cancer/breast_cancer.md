<h2 class="c-display-5">Distribution of Postoperative Stages in Breast Cancer Patients</h2>
<p class="lead">The changes in the number of patients who received breast cancer surgery within the past 10 years, and the distribution of postoperative stages in the patients (Stage IV patients do not receive the surgery in general, and are excluded from analysis).</p>

**Breast cancer:** A malignant tumor that occurs in the breast.

**Stage:** The stages are classified into 0, 1, II, III, and IV, based on breast cancer size (T), metastasis to the axillary node (N), and systemic metastasis (M).

At SNUBH, the number of breast cancer patients who received surgery continuously increased, resulting in 1,015 patients receiving surgery in a single year of 2017. The proportion of Stage I patients was the highest.

The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer was found to be:

* 100 % for Stage 0
* 98.5 % for Stage I
* 96.6 % for Stage II
* 84 % for Stage III

**Improvement**

1. Early detection of breast cancer and proactive treatment contributed to the improved survival rate for breast cancer.

<h2 class="c-display-5">5-Year Overall Survival of Patients with Breast Cancer by Subtype</h2>
<p class="lead">The proportion of patients who survived at least 5 years from the onset of treatment among those who received breast cancer surgery by subtype (Stage IV patients do not receive surgery in general, and are excluded from analysis).</p>

**Subtype:** The molecular subtype of breast cancer is a crucial factor for determining adjuvant therapy and prognosis. The subtypes are classified based on the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2 receptor, and Ki-67, into Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2, and Triple negative, respectively.

    <figcaption class="text-muted text-center">Fig. 3. The proportion of patients who survived at least 5 years from the onset of treatment among those who received breast cancer surgery by subtype.</figcaption>
</figure>

The 5-Year survival rate for breast cancer was found to be above 90 % for all subtypes. This is likely to be the result of proactive treatment based on multidisciplinary care and the expanded medical expenses support for cancer patients provided by the National Health Insurance Service. 

**Improvement**

1. Personalized care for individual patient characteristics has been proposed, based on multidisciplinary care from the departments of Surgery, Hematology & Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology and Plastic surgery.

<h2 class="c-display-5">Number of Breast Reconstruction Cases</h2>
<p class="lead">The number of breast reconstruction surgeries using free abdominal flap, pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle flap, tissue expander or implant.</p>

**Breast reconstruction:** A surgery that maximally reconstructs the original shape of the breast by using autologous tissues or prosthetic implants.

**Free abdominal flap:** Breast reconstruction surgery using transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous free flap or deep inferior epigastric artery perforator free flap.

**Pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle flap:** Breast reconstruction surgery using the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous pedicled flap.

**Tissue expander or implant:** Breast reconstruction surgery using tissue expander or implant.

</figure>

**Improvement**

The number of breast reconstruction surgeries using free abdominal flap, pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle flap, tissue expander or implant, showed an increasing trend. The majority of studies on breast reconstruction reported that the procedure alleviates the feeling of loss in women whose breast had to be removed and helps them maintain or regain femininity, ultimately enhancing the quality of life.

<p class="lead">The percentage of successful breast reconstruction cases that did not cause complications including flap necrosis and surgical site infection, after the surgeries using free abdominal flap, pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle flap, tissue expander or implant.</p>

**Flap necrosis:** A part or all of the flap was necrotic due to anastomotic failure or surgical site infection.

**Surgical site infection:** Clinical symptoms that indicated the infection of the area where a tissue expander or implant had been inserted, or a positive result of the bacterial culture test.
