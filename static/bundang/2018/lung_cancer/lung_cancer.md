Lung Cancer 
Number of Lung Cancer Surgery Cases
The number of cases where the patient was given a definite diagnosis of lung cancer after a lung resection with curative intent.
Curative intent : Cases where surgery was performed with an intent to remove the tumor completely; i.e. cases where the surgery was performed for histological examination are excluded.
Lung resection : All surgical procedures involving the removal of the lungs and bronchus including wedge resection, segmental resection, lobectomy, and pneumonectomy.

_

The number of lung cancer surgeries performed at SNUBH indicates an annual increasing trend. 
Improvement

1.	O PR events (Organization & Management of Lung Cancer Patient Support Group; Presentation of relevant research)
2.	Management of the Outpatient Multidisciplinary Care
3.	Management of short-stay hospital beds for the lung cancer test

# 

Percentage of Minimally Invasive Surgery for Lung Cancer
The number of thoracoscopies performed for lung resection divided by the total number of surgical procedures per year.

Thoracoscopy: Surgical resection of the lungs using various devices while looking through an endoscope inserted via minimal skin incision.

_

The higher the percentage, the more reliable the hospital is for the surgery using the minimal skin incision.
Improvement 
1.	Introduction of a 3D camera
2.	Workshop training for thoracoscopic surgery (twice a year)

# 

Average Postoperative Length of Stay, Lung Cancer
The average length of stay of patients who received lung cancer surgery.

Length of stay = Date of discharge - Date of surgery (The patients who died after surgery are excluded) 

_

The length of stay after lung cancer surgery is steadily decreasing.
Improvement
1.	Operation of Lung Cancer CP to reduce the Length of Stay
2.	Increased percentage of thoracoscopic surgery 
Data Source: Department of Thoracic & Cardiovascular Surgery Lung Cancer Registry, SNUBH EMR (Electronic Medical Record), CDW (Clinical Data Warehouse)

# 

Thirty Day Postoperative Mortality Rate, Lung Cancer
The number of patients who died within 30 days of lung cancer surgery or within the same hospital stay, divided by the number of patients who received lung cancer surgery 
Within 30 days (of surgery): Discharged patients who died during the 30-day period after surgery.
The same hospital stay: Patients who died during hospital stay post-surgery regardless of the length of stay.

_

The mortality rate indicates the risk of lung cancer surgery which is decreasing to zero in 2016.
Improvement
1.	Management of monthly conferences for minimizing complications
2.	A thorough follow-up monitoring after discharge

# 

5-Year Overall Survival of Patients with Lung Cancer by Stage
The stage-specific probability of survival for 5 or more years after lung cancer surgery.
Survival: Patients that survived irrespective of relapse.
Stage: The progression of cancer based on the size or status of metastasis to lymph nodes.

_

The rate of complete recovery from lung cancer varied according to the diagnosed stage of cancer after respective surgery.
Improvement
1.	High-precision surgical treatment
2.	Postoperative multidisciplinary care based on guidelines
3.	A thorough follow-up monitoring after surgery

Incidence of Postoperative Pneumonia
The incidence of pneumonia after surgery.
Pneumonia diagnosis criteria (If three out of the five items below are checked) 
1.	Fever reaching 38.3 °C or above
2.	Leukocytosis
3.	X-ray showing pigmented parts due to infiltration
4.	Detection of bacteria in sputum culture
5.	Cases involving antibiotics treatment

Pneumonia is a common complication after lung cancer surgery and the most frequent cause of death.
Improvement 
1.	Reduced surgery time
2.	Management of high-risk patients - pulmonary rehabilitation and prohibition of smoking
3.	Integrated care provided by collaboration with the Department of Pulmonology
